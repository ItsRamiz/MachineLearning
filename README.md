Implementation of the machine learning algorithms learned in the course

1. Naive Bayes Classifier - The algorithm was used to classify given sentences into 8 different categories, I've used Laplace smoothing to smooth categorical data
2. PCA - Was used to reduce the dimensions of images from 28x28 to 9x9 and and then try to recover the whole size again (always choosing the optimal dimension).
   and KNN was used find the most-fit vectors to help us in recovering the images to their original size while preserving the most quality.
3. Logistic Regression via Gradiet Descent - Was used classify weither 100 students passed (1) or failed (0) a course based on various factors.
